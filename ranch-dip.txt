Cauliflower Ranch Dip RecipeMakes 1 ½ cups/6 servingsThis is a low-fat, low-calorie, dairy-free ranch dip that is sure to please even the most devoted ranch lover. It goes great with vegetables, especially broccoli florets; in fact I’ve been known to eat an entire crown of broccoli so long as it’s accompanied by this dip!1½ cups steamed cauliflower florets* ½ cup unflavored almond milk2 tablespoons grapeseed oil2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar2 tablespoons hemp seeds½ teaspoon Dijon mustard¼ teaspoon garlic powderShot of hot sauce, to taste½ teaspoon sea salt ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper2 tablespoons fresh chives, mincedPlace the cauliflower in a blender, along with the almond milk, grapeseed oil, apple cider vinegar, and hemp seeds. Blend for a full minute, or until completely smooth and creamy. Add the Dijon mustard, garlic powder, hot sauce, along with the sea salt and black pepper, then blend to combine. Taste and adjust salt and pepper if needed. Add the chives and blend briefly just to incorporate, without processing the chives too much.
